## PKGLOG - Linux utility to output concise log of package changes
[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pkglog)](https://pypi.org/project/pkglog/)
[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/pkglog)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pkglog/)

This is a Linux command line utility to output a concise list of
packages installed, removed, upgraded, downgraded, or reinstalled. It
should be able to parse package log formats used by the common Linux
distributions. Example output is shown below.

1. Most terminals show this output in color, as seen above. Five
   different colors are used to identify the package actions as shown
   in the table below. You can choose to disable colored output.

2. Changes are grouped together by time so you can distinguish the group
   of packages changed each time you did package
   updates/installs/removal. By default, all changes with less than a
   succeeding 2 minute gap between any of them are grouped together, but
   you can change that time value.

3. By default, only package changes over the last 30 days are shown. You
   can choose to specify the number of days back, or from a specific
   date (optionally plus a time, or specify just a time and today is
   assumed), or for all time.

4. The `LAST SYSTEM BOOT` line shows you which packages have been
   changed since the last boot, e.g. if the linux kernel package has
   updated you may decide to reboot asap.

5. You can specify a package name and only changes to that package are
   shown. See the USAGE section below.

6. You can use the `-n/--installed-net` option to see a list of all
   packages currently installed and their date of installation. E.g. use
   this option after you have installed and removed a heap of trial
   packages and you want to easily see if you have actually removed all
   of them and their dependencies. E.g. `pkglog -n -d0` shows a net
   summary of packages you ended up installing today.

See the latest documentation and code at https://github.com/bulletmark/pkglog.

## COLORED OUTPUT LINES

|Package Action|Line Text Color
|--------------|-----
|Installed     |green
|Removed       |red
|Upgraded      |yellow
|Downgraded    |magenta
|Reinstalled   |cyan

You can use a command line option to disable colored output, or set it
as a [default option](#default-options).

## LOG FILE FORMATS

Parsers for the following log formats currently exist. The appropriate
parser for you system is normally automatically determined.
Alternatively, you can choose the log directory[s], file[s], and/or
parser explicitly using the `-p/--parser` option. A very simple parser
plugin architecture is used, so creating a new parser is easy. Simply
drop the parser file in the `parsers/` directory and the program will
automatically use it. See the [current parsers](pkglog/parsers) for
example code.

|Log Parser|Default Path           |Distribution       |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------------|
|apt       |`/var/log/apt/history*`|Debian, Ubuntu, etc|
|dnf       |`/var/log/dnf.rpm.log` |RedHat, Fedora, etc|
|pacman    |`/var/log/pacman.log`  |Arch, Manjaro, etc |
|zypper    |`/var/log/zypp/history`|OpenSUSE           |

## USAGE

Type `pkglog -h` to view the usage summary:

```
usage: pkglog [-h] [-u] [-i] [-I] [-n] [-d DAYS] [-a] [-j] [-v] [-c]
                   [-p {pacman,zypper,apt,dnf}] [-t TIMEGAP] [-P PATH]
                   [-g | -r]
                   [package]

Reports concise log of package changes.

positional arguments:
  package               specific package name to report

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --updated-only    show updated only
  -i, --installed       show installed/removed only
  -I, --installed-only  show installed only
  -n, --installed-net   show net installed only
  -d DAYS, --days DAYS  show all packages only from given number of days ago,
                        or from given YYYY-MM-DD[?HH:MM[:SS]],
                        default=30(days), 0=today, -1=all. If only time is
                        specified, then today is assumed.
  -a, --alldays         show all packages for all days (same as "--days=-1")
  -j, --nojustify       don't right justify version numbers
  -v, --verbose         be verbose, describe upgrades/downgrades
  -c, --no-color        do not color output lines
  -p {pacman,zypper,apt,dnf}, --parser {pacman,zypper,apt,dnf}
                        log parser type, default=pacman
  -t TIMEGAP, --timegap TIMEGAP
                        max minutes gap between grouped changes, default=2
  -P PATH, --path PATH  alternate log path[s] (separate multiple using ":",
                        must be time sequenced)
  -g, --glob            given package name is glob pattern to match
  -r, --regex           given package name is regular expression to match

Note you can set default starting options in ~/.config/pkglog-flags.conf.
```

## DEFAULT OPTIONS

You can add default options to a personal configuration file
`~/.config/pkglog-flags.conf`. If that file exists then each line of
options in the file will be concatenated and automatically prepended
to your `pkglog` command line options.

This allow you to set default preferred starting options to `pkglog`.
Type `pkglog -h` to see the options supported.
E.g. `echo "--days 7" >~/.config/pkglog-flags.conf` to make `pkglog`
only display the last 7 days of changes by default. This is also useful
to set your parser explicitly using `-p/--parser` (e.g. if the default
parser is not automatically determined correctly on your system).

## INSTALLATION

Arch Linux users can install [pkglog from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pkglog). Python 3.7 or later is
required. [`python-packaging`](https://pypi.org/project/packaging/) is
required. The [`python-rich`](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) package is
required if you want colored output (which is the default unless you
specify the `-c/--no-color` option).

Note [pkglog is on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pkglog/) so just
ensure that `python3-pip` and `python3-wheel` are installed then type
the following to install (or upgrade):

```
$ sudo pip3 install -U pkglog
```

Alternatively, do the following to install from the source repository.

```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/bulletmark/pkglog
$ cd pkglog
$ sudo pip3 install -U .
```

## UPGRADE

```sh
$ cd pkglog  # Source dir, as above
$ git pull
$ sudo pip3 install -U .
```

## REMOVAL

```sh
$ sudo pip3 uninstall pkglog
```
